This folder contains some additional disk files that were used for testing and debugging gXR5.  Current in this folder there are the files,

- inittab
- logo.txt

The inittab here replaces the default inittab generated by buildroot (in the buildroot image under /etc/inittab).  It includes various fixes and workarounds we found were necessary during preliminary testing of gXR5.

The logo.txt file is just for fun and is read on gXR5 system startup.  To use it, put it in /logo.txt in your buildroot image.
