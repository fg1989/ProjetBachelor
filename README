The goal of this project is to implement full system (FS) mode with Linux support for RISC-V architectures in the gem5 architectural simulator.  Currently gem5 supports syscall emulation (SE) mode for RISC-V architectures based on the unprivileged ISA specification.  At minimum, implementing FS mode with Linux requires the privileged ISA specification be implemented with a RV64IMAC core.  A rough action item list (subject to change) is as follows:

- Implement the privileged ISA specification (v1.11 ratified Machine ISA and Supervisor ISA, source: https://riscv.org/specifications/privileged-isa/) with extensions I, M, A, C.
-- Must support user, supervisor, and machine modes.
-- Requires implementing URET, SRET. MRET. WFI, and SFENCE.VMA instructions. Hypervisor instructions HFENCE.BVMA and HFENCE.GVMA would also be good to have.
-- Requires a TLB implementation for memory address translations.
-- Must support FS mode functionality for all control and state registers (CSRs).
-- Refinement of currently-implemented fault subsystem (for interrupts and exceptions).
- Implement Linux OS support.
-- Need to gauge support for threads and contexts.
-- Ability to boot off RISC-V-compiled Linux disk image.
- Calibrate statistics and verify results against real hardware.
-- Current plan is to use the HiFive Unleashed SoC (https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive-unleashed) for verification.

This is the gem5 simulator.

The main website can be found at http://www.gem5.org

A good starting point is http://www.gem5.org/Introduction, and for
more information about building the simulator and getting started
please see http://www.gem5.org/Documentation and
http://www.gem5.org/Tutorials.

To build gem5, you will need the following software: g++ or clang,
Python (gem5 links in the Python interpreter), SCons, SWIG, zlib, m4,
and lastly protobuf if you want trace capture and playback
support. Please see http://www.gem5.org/Dependencies for more details
concerning the minimum versions of the aforementioned tools.

Once you have all dependencies resolved, type 'scons
build/<ARCH>/gem5.opt' where ARCH is one of ALPHA, ARM, NULL, MIPS,
POWER, SPARC, or X86. This will build an optimized version of the gem5
binary (gem5.opt) for the the specified architecture. See
http://www.gem5.org/Build_System for more details and options.

With the simulator built, have a look at
http://www.gem5.org/Running_gem5 for more information on how to use
gem5.

The basic source release includes these subdirectories:
   - configs: example simulation configuration scripts
   - ext: less-common external packages needed to build gem5
   - src: source code of the gem5 simulator
   - system: source for some optional system software for simulated systems
   - tests: regression tests
   - util: useful utility programs and files

To run full-system simulations, you will need compiled system firmware
(console and PALcode for Alpha), kernel binaries and one or more disk
images. Please see the gem5 download page for these items at
http://www.gem5.org/Download

If you have questions, please send mail to gem5-users@gem5.org

Enjoy using gem5 and please share your modifications and extensions.
